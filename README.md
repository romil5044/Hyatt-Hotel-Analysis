# Hyatt-Hotel-Analysis
Hyatt Hotels provided us with 12 months of raw data from millions of their customers. 
I used data cleaning techniques to remove redundancies and null values to get a clean working data set.
I further analyzed this data set by developing functions to find out which customer is more likely to recommend the hotel. 
Performed predictive analysis and utilized machine learning algorithms such as regression techniques, SVM, KSVM and KNN 

The end product was a set of recommendations for the hotel to improve their customer base along with an array of visualizations
developed in R.
